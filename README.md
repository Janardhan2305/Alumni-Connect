Alumni Connect is a comprehensive, full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between current students and alumni of the Prasad V Potluri Siddhartha Institute of Technology. It serves as a dynamic community hub for networking, mentorship, and career guidance, featuring role-based access for both administrators and general users.

This project was built with a modern, serverless architecture, leveraging the power of React for the frontend and Google Firebase for all backend services.
